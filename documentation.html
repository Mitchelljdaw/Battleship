    <h1>Game Requirements</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript:</b>My function createTable(colums, rows) generates the gamegrid and functions generateYourBoard() and generateOppBoard() apply css to change the color of cells based on whether or not the cell has a ship in it, has been hit, missed, or nothing has happened to cell.</li>
      <li><b>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons:</b>I have a text box input. Focus will start in this box and allow user to type in thier name if they want. Once typed in the user can click enter to have thier name disp;ayed above their gameboard. The start game button will place the opponants and the users game peices on the board and start a game. if user clicks start game twice it will alert them that they need to press the new game button to stop game and allow them to start a new game. Several onther functions are called by these buttons that will satisfy later requirments.</li>
      <li><b>User input in the form of mouse clicks:</b>When user clicks on the opponants board it will either indicate a hit by changing the color of the cell to black, or a miss changing the color to red. A click will also indicate to the computer that it can make a guess on the users board. user can not click on his own board and can not guess the same spot twice.</li>
      <li><b>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions:</b>When a user enters thier name into the name text box the "Your Name" div innerHTML will be changed to the name the user typed in. The innerHTML of the "Information" div is also changed when it diplays game data from XML file and the "debug" div will display local storage data.</li>
      <li><b>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page:</b>When the user click the new game button information the amojnt of games won by the user and the computer is pulled from local storage and then grabs the data from the XML file and diplays it in the "information" div.</li>
      <li><b>Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage:</b>Each time a ship(either users or computers) is completely sunken a small explosion sound will happen. This is done by using a dynamically allocated audio function in javascript and calling the play method on that function each time the ship is sunk.</li>
      <li><b>Game logic code:</b>Each time the user click on a box it will change the turn attribute in the gamestate object to the opponants turn and same goes for when the computer makes a guess. When user clicks on a cell the getCell fuction will be called and check the oppGird in the gameState object to see if the the corresponding element is a 6 5 4 3 2 9 or 10.If it is a 9 or 10 the user will be alerted that they have already guessed here. If the computer guessees 9 or 10 if will guess again until it finds a cell that has not been guessed yet. if it is numbers 2-6 it will indicate that it was a hit by marking the cell black. based on the number it will know which ship was hit and will increase that ships damage in either the yourShips object or the oppShips object. If the damage of that ship is equal to the size of the ship then the ship will be sunk and the game will tell the user that they have sunk a certain ship or that the computer has sunken one of thier ships.If the guess is a miss the cell will turn red and the corresponding elements in the board objects will change to a 9, if it was a hit it will change to a 10.If either players ships damages are all equal to each ships sizes the game will end and based on the turn attribute in the Gamestate object the game will display who has won and will update that information in the local storage. The user will not be able to click on the opp boards not and will be asked to click the new game button to be able to start a new game by clicking on the start game button.</li>
      <li><b>Extra Credit:</b>In addition to using the audio when ships are sunk i use local storage to save and display the amount of wins that you and the computer have had. this is all done in the loadData function and the click function. </li>
